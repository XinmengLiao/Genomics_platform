# Allele Frequency Tools  

## Introduction of the tool  

This tool is used as a "blueprint" of all variants that found in the in-house uploaded sequencing samples. The webpage mainly including two sections:
- The **SNPs** in-house allele frequencies that dynamically calculated from all the uploaded samples.
- The **CNV/SVs** searching functions, that allow users to find a specific genomic regions, checking the CNVs/SVs records that existed in the uploaded samples.

## Quick start

### SNP allele frequencies

1. **View files**  
By clicking this button, a list of all uploaded files (by sample name) are shown.  
  
2. **Export all calculation results of in-house allele frequencies**  
The calculation is based on the formula:

To be more specific, 
3. **Search / Scrolling tab**

All of SNPs are named as the format chr:pos:Ref/Alt, the percentage indicated the newest calculated allele frequency.
