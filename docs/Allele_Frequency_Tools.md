# Introduction of the tool

This tool is used as a "blueprint" of all variants that found in the in-house uploaded sequencing samples. The webpage mainly including two sections:
-1. the SNPs in-house allele frequencies that dynamically calculated from all the uploaded samples.
-2. the CNV/SVs searching functions, that allow users to find a specific genomic regions, checking the CNVs/SVs records that existed in the uploaded samples.

# Quick start

-1. SNP allele frequencies

All of SNPs are named as the format chr:pos:Ref/Alt, the percentage indicated the newest calculated allele frequency.
