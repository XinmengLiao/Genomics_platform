# Allele Frequency Tools  

## Introduction of the tool  

This tool is used as a "blueprint" of all variants that found in the in-house uploaded sequencing samples. The webpage mainly including two sections:
- The **SNPs** in-house allele frequencies that dynamically calculated from all the uploaded samples.
- The **CNV/SVs** searching functions, that allow users to find a specific genomic regions, checking the CNVs/SVs records that existed in the uploaded samples.

## Quick start

### SNP allele frequencies
<img width="1197" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0303c2b-93d6-4a04-a6a0-0a6cfd5cfc98" />

All of SNPs are named as the format chr:pos:Ref/Alt, the percentage indicated the newest calculated allele frequency. 

1. **View files**  
By clicking this button, a list of all uploaded files (by sample name) are shown.  
  
2. **Export all calculation results of in-house allele frequencies**  
The calculation is based on the formula:
Allele Frequency = Total allele count of the SNP / 2* (Total Number of Individuals) whereas Total allele count is calculated referring the heterozygous/homozygous status of the variant.  

3. **Search / Scrolling tab**  
Here, by searching (input the chromosome location of the variants that interested) and scrolling the user is able to view all variants detected.

4. **Expand/More details**
Clicking this arrow will show all the sample IDs that carrying the specific variant being searched.

5. **Export variant-specific results**   
This button allows downloading of a CSV file including all the sample IDs that carrying the specific variant being searched.  

6.**View specific raw results table**  
This button allows expanding the raw result file (generated by GenRiskPro/BabySeqPro,including prioritized variants list with gene/disease information) for the specific sample.

7.**Back to all samples list**
In the result file page, clicking "Back" will returns to the list of all samples uploaded.

8. **Export whole sample-specific Results (CSV format)**
This button allows downloading a CSV file of raw result file of the specific sample.

9. **Sample-based view page**
From the button **1** or button **7**, users will return to a page showing all samples that uploaded. The search tab allows searching by sample IDs as well as scrolling by mouse.
